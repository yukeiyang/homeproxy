# openwrt x86-64 firmware with luci-app-homeproxy integrated  

This is a firmware based on openwrt x86-64, integrated with luci-app-homeproxy.  
  
It is really fucking clean, containing luci-app-homeproxy and its dependences only. I hate one firmware installed lots of complicated IPKs. That's the reason why I create this repo here.
  
When flash this firmware, you can choose `Keep settings and retain the current configuration` during the `Flash Image`.  
  
Orï¼Œflash the image as brand new one.  

Management IP: 192.168.2.1  
wan port: LAN1  
lan port: LAN2 LAN3 LAN4 ...

Hope you enjoy using it!
