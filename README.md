# openwrt x86-64 firmware with luci-app-homeproxy integrated  

This is a firmware based on openwrt x86-64, integrated with luci-app-homeproxy.  
  
It is really fucking clean, containing luci-app-homeproxy and dependences only. I really hate one firmware installed different kinds of IPKs, that's why I create this firmware.
  
You can choose `Keep settings and retain the current configuration` during the `Flash Image` when you flash this firmware.  
  
Or，you can flash the image as a brand new one.  

Management IP: 192.168.2.1  
Wan Port: LAN1  
Lan Port: LAN2 LAN3 LAN4 ...     
Username: root  
Password: (none)  

Hope you enjoy using it!
